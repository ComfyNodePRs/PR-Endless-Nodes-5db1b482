# Endless-Nodes
Some basic custom nodes for the ComfyUI user interface for Stable Diffusion.

When using the [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) interface for [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion), I sometimes find that the standard nodes and the many, many, many custom nodes out there don't work the way I want them to, or how I think they do.

Rightly or wrongly, I am pretending to teach myself a bit of Python to get some nodes up and running to do what I'd like.  There are no promises that these nodes will work for you or that I will maintain them.  Feel free to do with them as you wish, according to the license model.

**UPDATE: Sep 18, 2023**

Added the Endless Nodes Parameterizer with Text_G and Text_L prompt box
Added the Parameterizer with a_score for both pos/neg
Added the Parameterizer with a_score for both pos/neg and Text_G and Text_L prompt box
Fixed some typos


**UPDATE: Sep 17, 2023**

Added the Endless Nodes Parameterizer


## Install

Navigate to your /ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ folder 

In Windows, you can then right-click to start a command prompt and type:

`git clone https://github.com/tusharbhutt/Endless-Nodes`

You can also get the nodes via the [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)

## Node List

### Six Text Input Switch
Allows the user to select between six text inputs and uses a slider to make the selection.  Useful for multiple inputs for prompt creation

### Six Integer Input to Six Integer Output
I've seen a fair number of 3-, 4-, or more way text input and outputs, I wanted to do something for numbers as well.  Use it as you wish.

### Six Integer Widget
As above, but with widgets for entry instead of connectors

### Endless Node Parameterizer 

This node has a collection of inputs for the CLIP text Encoder and Refiners for SDXL based workflows

Inputs include:

- base width: set width for the base encoder
- base height: set height for the base encoder
- base cropped width: crop width for the base encoder
- base cropped height: crop height for the base encoder
- base target width: target width for the base encoder
- base target height: target height for the base encoder
- refiner width: crop width for the refiner if you have included one
- refiner height: crop height for the refiner if you have included one
- refiner aesthetic score: set the score value for the refiner

You can set up two of these one for the positive and one for the negative prompt

## Parameterizer with prompt

As above, but with TEXT_G and TEXT_L  outputs

![parameterizerprompt](./img/parameterizerprompt.png)

## COMBO Parameterizer with and without prompt

After making the Parameterizer, I realized having two separate ones for both the positive and negative CLIP encoders is not optimal, because almost everyone will use the same resolution for both the positive and negative base and refiners.  However, you may (well, you *shouldâ€¦*) want separate aesthetic scorers for the positive and negative CLIPs, so also I came up with one that does this for you.  Also comes in a variant that has the prompt boxes for you.
