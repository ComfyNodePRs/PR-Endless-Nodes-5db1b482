# Endless-Nodes
Some basic custom nodes for the ComfyUI user interface for Stable Diffusion.

When using the ComfyUI interface for STable Diffusion, I sometimes find that the standard nodes and the many, many, many custom nodes out there don't work the way I want them to.

Rightly or wrongly, I am pretending to each myself a bit of Python to get some nodes up and running to do what I'd like.  There are no promises that these nodes will work for you or that I will maintain them.  Feel free to do with them as you wish, according to the license model.
